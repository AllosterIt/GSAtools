#       REQUIREMENTS
#
GSATools requires the following software: 
- gromacs 4.5.x                 http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads
- gsl                           http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

GROMACS should have been compiled as a set of shared libraries (--enable-shared)
in serial mode, i.e. without using MPI. GSATools is currently not implemented
to work with a parallel version of GROMACS. Future versions will include full
compatibility.

If you installed the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for Linux using your
distribution package manager, please check to have installed both gsl and 
gsl-dev (or gsl-devel) packages.

Additionally to perform the tutorial you may want to install the following
software:
- R                             http://www.r-project.org
- igraph                        http://cran.r-project.org
- qvalue                        http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qvalue.html
- bio3d                         http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d

#
#       INSTALLATION
#
You need the location of your GROMACS installation (e.g. /usr/local/gromacs).
You will have to set the GMXDIR variable to this value (see step 2).

To compile GSATools follow these steps:

1. untar the distribution package and change dir
        tar xvfz gromacs_sa_tools-4.5.x-1.00.tar.gz
        cd gromacs_sa_tools-4.5.x-1.00
2. set the environment GMXDIR variable (use setenv if you have t/csh)
        export GMXDIR=/usr/local/gromacs
3. run the configure script
        ./configure
4. compile the software
        make
5. test the software (results are generated in the tests subdir)
        make check

If you decide to install the software, the default installation location
is /usr/local (this can be changed at step 3 with the command
./configure --prefix=<my-install-path>).
6. 
        make install

Compiler flags and required libraries are checked automatically by configure.
The program will tell you if something is missing. If your gsl libraries are
installed in a non-standard path you can use the flag --with-gsl=<my-path-to-gsl>
to specify the correct path. The configuration option --enable-debug creates 
a debuggable binary. The option --enable-profiling enables profiling with GNU
gprof. More details on additional options for configure are available with
 ./configure --help

################################################################################
#
#       REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
#
Upon successful compilation, configuration scripts of the type 'GSATOOLSRC.*sh'
are created for various shell types in the scripts directory. It is advisable 
to run the script matching your terminal shell to set all required environment
variables for correct execution of g_sa_encode and g_sa_analyze.

If you have installed the software (see step 6 before) the configuration scripts
will be copied to the install directory alongside with the binaries of the two 
programs g_sa_encode and g_sa_analyze.

################################################################################
#
#       MPI COMPILATION OPTION
#
The calculation of the MI matrix with g_sa_analyze can be considerably accelerated
by using MPI. To compile GSATools using MPI you should enable it at step 3 of the
installation:
        configure --enable-mpi
and if MPI is not installed in a default location:
        configure --enable-mpi --with-mpi=<my-path-to-mpi>

N.B.: Also in this case, the required GROMACS installation should have been 
compiled in serial mode, i.e. without using MPI. GSATools is currently not 
implemented to work with a parallel version of GROMACS. Future versions will
include full compatibility.
