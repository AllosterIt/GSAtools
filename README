GSATools project
----------------
GSAtools is a set of programs that translate ensembles of protein conformations
into alignments of structural strings using a Structural Alphabet (SA) and
perform a wide range of statistical analyses.

Install
-------
Please read the general 'INSTALL' instructions.

Usage
-----
GSAtools has been integrated into the Gromacs environment and it uses the
standard syntax of Gromacs analysis tools. Help info for each tool can be
printed out using the --help flag, e.g.:

g_sa_encode --help

Please refer also to the examples provided in the Test suite and in the Tutorial
included in this distribution.

R scripts for the analysis and data visualisation are included in the Rscripts
directory. All the scripts can be easily modified to process user-provided data
by changing the parameters in the first section of the files.
